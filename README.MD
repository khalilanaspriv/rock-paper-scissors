## ✨ About The Project

I just wanted to create a simple rock paper scissors game to practice and sharpen my HTML, CSS, JS skills. This has helped me understand better the concept of **variables**, **conditionals**, **functions**, in addition to how to use **localStorage**. I tried to make it have a retro look by using black and white colors and also using pixel art icons for the possible picks.

### 🛠️ Built With

The project was entirely built using vanilla HTML, CSS, JS.
