## ✨ About The Project

I just wanted to create a simple rock paper scissors game to practice and sharpen my HTML, CSS, JS skills. This has helped me understand better the concept of variables, conditionals, functions, in addition to how to use localStorage. I tried to make it have a retro look by using black and white colors and also using pixel art icons for the possible picks.

### 🛠️ Built With

The project was entirely built using vanilla HTML, CSS, JS.
